# p-DeGroot simulation

This repo contains simulation code for p-DeGroot model on finite graphs.  
The file `minimize_lp_energy.py` (and the accompanying `SyncDegrootModel.py`) is intended for usage with general graphs, using `networkx`.
The file `lp_energy_torus_matrix.py` is intended for usage with the torus graphs (the grid Z_m\timesZ_n).
